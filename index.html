      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language epic action
      thriller film directed by Prashanth Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur
      under Hombale Films. The film stars Prabhas in the titular role, alongside
      Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya
      Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj,
      Brahmaji and Mime Gopi. In the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar,
      where monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship between Deva
      (Prabhas), the exiled prince of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj
      Sukumaran), the current prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned
      by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help
      to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler. The film's initial storyline was
      pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and is the maiden part of a
      two-part film.[4] It was officially announced in December 2020 under the
      title Salaar, however, in July 2023, its first installment was titled as
      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal photography commenced in January
      2021, and occurred sporadically in several legs over nearly three years,
      before wrapping in late 2023. Filming locations included Telangana, Italy
      and Budapest. Production difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots
      and VFX delays, postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music
      is composed by Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and
      editing by Ujwal Kulkarni.
